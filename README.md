# C# - Delegates
<P>What if we want to pass a function as a parameter? How does C# handles the callback functions or event handler? <br>The answer is - delegate.</p>

<p>The delegate is a reference type data type that defines the method signature. You can define variables of delegate, <br>just like other data type, that can refer to any method with the same signature as the delegate.</p>

<p>There are three steps involved while working with delegates:</p>
<ol>
 <li>1.Declare a delegate </li>
<li> Create an instance and reference a method</li>
<li> Invoke a delegate </li>
</ol>
<br>
